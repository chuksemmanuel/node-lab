# node-lab

A minimal Node.js playground. This project serves as a base for experimenting with various Node.js concepts in isolated Git branches.

Each experiment or "lab" is developed in its own branch, branching off from this main starter.

## 📁 Structure

This `main` branch includes:

- A basic `index.js` file with a simple Express server
- Minimal dependencies
- No TypeScript — we'll add that in specific lab branches

## 🧪 Labs

Each experiment lives in a separate branch:

| Branch | Description                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `main` | Vanilla Node.js with Express |

> Run `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch to a specific lab.
